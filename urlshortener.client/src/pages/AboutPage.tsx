                        This service provides URL shortening by generating a random 6-character code composed of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.
                        When a user submits a long URL, the system ensures that the same URL hasn't already been shortened. If not, it creates a new short code.
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>
                        The short code is guaranteed to be unique by checking the database before saving. If a collision is detected, a new code is generated.
                        Once a unique short code is produced, the original URL, its short version, creation date, and user ID are stored.
                    </Paragraph>
                </div>
            </Content>

            <SiteFooter />
